\usage{
unknown_date(x, format = "ymd", possible = c("earliest", "latest"), ...)

earliest_date(year, month = NA, day = NA)

latest_date(year, month = NA, day = NA)

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a date "string" (see details)}

\item{format}{A date "format" (see details)}

\item{possible}{Whether to look at earliest or latest}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to `extract_date()`}

\item{year}{Year}

\item{month}{Month}

\item{day}{Day}

\item{as_date}{Logical, if TRUE will return the output as a date}
}
\description{
Incomplete dates cannot be directly coerced into date values in R.
}
\details{
These functions help resolve some of those issues by providing the earliest
  or possible dates from an inexact date.  For example, the value `"2010-10"`
  cannot be resolved because the day is missing.  These functions will either
  return `"2010-10-01"` or `"2010-10-31"` depending on the settings.
  Likewise, if the month is missing (e.g., `"1950-UN-15"`) we can still use
  the earliest (i.e., `"1950-01-15"`) or the latest (i.e., `"1950-12-15"`).

These could greatly help complete a data set that has many missing or
  inexact dates that still need to be considered.


`unknown_date` is a vectorized function which implements the non-vectorized
  `earliest_date` and `latest_date`.
If a split vector of 2 is passed to `unknown_date`, it is assumed that the
  vector consists of the Month and Year.
If a split vector of 1 is passed to `unknown_date`, it is assumed that the
  vector consists only of the Year.
For cases in which the year is not provided or the month is unknown, it is
  suggested that these be recoded before using this function.

The `as_date` parameter is used to allow the `unknown_date` function to work
  with a character vector and change the date class at the end
